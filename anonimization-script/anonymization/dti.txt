Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) use different gradient directions so that different images are sensitive to specific directions.

In order to process this data with medINRIA or FSL, you need to extract the diffusion direction information as well as the images.

For these images, dcm2nii will attempt to generate .bvec and .bval text files.

This information is extracted from the DICOM header (for Siemens data the software attempts to read the "B_value" and "DiffusionGradientDirection" fields from the CSA header).
